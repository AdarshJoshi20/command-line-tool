This code is a command-line tool implemented using Python's click library. 
It allows a user to input text or a file path to text and then generates a summary of the text using the Ollama API and Qwen2 model.

The function "summarize" takes text and file_path as arguments.
"url" and "headers" are defined for the Ollama API request.

If text is provided directly by the user, then it's split into paragraphs using double newline ('\n' '\n') as a delimiter.
 This handles the case where the text might contain multiple paragraphs.
The paragraphs are then joined into a single string with spaces to form the prompt for the summarization.

If file_path is provided by the user, the code attempts to open and read the file.
It handles potential errors such as FileNotFoundError and other OSError exceptions.
The file contents are processed similarly to the direct text input, splitting by paragraphs and joining them into a single prompt string.

The final prompt is formatted to include "summarize this" followed by the text or file contents so that the Ollama's Qwen2 model can summarize the text.

API Request:
url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
This is the endpoint of the Ollama API where the request is sent.
http://localhost:11434 indicates that the API is hosted locally on port 11434.

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
The headers dictionary specifies that the content type of the request body is application/json.
This is necessary because the API expects the input data in JSON format.

data = {
    "model": "qwen2",
    "prompt": f"summarize this {prompt}",
    "stream": False
}

The 'data' dictionary contains the information that will be sent in the body of the POST request:
"model": "qwen2" specifies the model to be used for generating the summary.
"prompt": f"summarize this {prompt}" contains the actual prompt that the model will process. The prompt is prefixed with "summarize this" followed by the text or file contents.
"stream": False is an additional parameter indicating whether to stream the response.

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

requests.post() is used to send a POST request to the API.
'url' is the endpoint we defined earlier.
'headers' is the headers dictionary specifying the content type.
data=json.dumps(data) converts the data dictionary to a JSON-formatted string because the requests library requires the data to be in string format when the content type is JSON.


Success Handling:

if response.status_code == 200: checks if the request was successful (status code 200).
summary_json = response.json() converts the response content from JSON format to a Python dictionary.
summary_text = summary_json.get('response', 'No summary available') extracts the summary text from the response. If the key 'response' is not found, it defaults to 'No summary available'.
click.echo("Summary:") and click.echo(summary_text) print the summary text to the console.


Error Handling:
else: handles the case where the status code is not 200, indicating a failed request.
click.echo(f"Failed to summarize. Status code: {response.status_code}") prints an error message with the status code
